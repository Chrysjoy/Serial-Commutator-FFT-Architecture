# 4-Point Serial Commutator FFT (Mini Project)

This project implements a **4-point Serial Commutator (SC) FFT architecture** inspired by the methodology presented in the IEEE paper:

**“Optimised Serial Commutator FFT Architecture in Terms of Multiplexers”**  
*Fang et al., IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II, 2024.*

While the original paper proposes a **16-point FFT**, this mini-project focuses on a **scaled-down 4-point version** to understand the architecture, data flow, and hardware optimisation concepts.

## Files Included
- RTL design files (Verilog)  
- Testbench  
- Simulation results (waveforms)  

## Tools Used
- Quartus II 13.1 (64-bit) Web Edition   
- ModelSim

## How to Simulate
1. Add files from `src/` and `testbench/` to your simulator.  
2. Run the testbench.  
3. View FFT outputs or waveforms.
