# 4-Point Serial Commutator FFT (Mini Project)

This project implements a **4-point Serial Commutator (SC) FFT architecture** inspired by the methodology presented in the IEEE paper:

**“Optimised Serial Commutator FFT Architecture in Terms of Multiplexers”**  
*Fang et al., IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II, 2024.*

While the original paper proposes a **16-point FFT**, this mini-project focuses on a **scaled-down 4-point version** to understand the architecture, data flow, and hardware optimisation concepts.
